# i am stenkos 🙂
### what i do (hopefully useful)
i code languages such as:
- python 🐍
- some html/css 🕸️
- scratch 🐱

i want to add more but i do not know javascript, i believe i am intermediate when i have learned java(script)<br>i am only a master when i get a neckbeard

to do:
- the above ^ 🚫
- find out what the github.io thing is 🚫
- make a site using the github.io thing 🚫
- code something which makes someone else's life better 🚫

essentially, until i get a star or a comment saying "wow that was useful" i am still a ways to go
